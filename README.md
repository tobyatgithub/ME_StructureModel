## ME_StructureModel
### **General**  
This is the project I did during Summer 2015 - Fall 2016 for the Mechanical Engieering Department at University of Rochester with Prof. Perucchio. 
The overall goal is to create a **web application** where students can input parameters of pre-defined structures and see how parameters will effect structures'
ability to sustain horizontal accelerations (a mimic to earthquake.)

On the top of the interactive component, this web also feature an automated four-bar mechanism calculator. Given the parameter combo users type in,
this web application will yield the critical horizontal acceleration. And the failure cases are plotted in canvas, with the critical one in red.

This web is written in html5, css, and javascript.
