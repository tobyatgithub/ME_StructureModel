## ME_StructureModel
### **General**  
This is the project I did during Summer 2015 - Fall 2016 for the Mechanical Engieering Department at University of Rochester with Prof. Perucchio. 
The overall goal is to create a **web application** where students can input parameters of pre-defined structures and see how parameters will effect structures' ability to sustain horizontal accelerations (a mimic to earthquake.)  
You can find the [web here.](http://www2.me.rochester.edu/projects/structuremodel/Toby_ME_9_May.html)

### **Content**
This web application contains several features:  
1. Interactive input--users can choose their own parameters for pre-defined structures and explore the effect. 
2. This web will automatically yield (and plot) the center of mass of each blocks for any given paramters (realized by finite element analysis on backend via javascript.)  
3. This web also feature an automated four-bar mechanism calculator. Given the parameter combo users type in, the critical horizontal acceleration will be calculated and plotted on canvas. 
4. "Naive Animation". After users typed in parameters, the images of failure cases will be plotted in canvas, with the critical one in red.

This web is written in html5, css, and javascript.
